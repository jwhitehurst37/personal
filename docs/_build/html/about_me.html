<p>I grew up in Lakeland, FL, USA. I’m married to Morgan Macey, a soon-to-be graduate of USF’s Humanities MA program and aspiring museum director and educator. We have five wee fur-babies; our ferrets named Ferretson Ford, Madame Furie the Radioactive Weasel (“Little Bit”), and Gallaudet (“Gal”), and our cats, Freyja and Hecate.</p>

<h2>My Working Life<a class="headerlink" href="#my-working-life" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I decided to get married early and begin working full time while completing my Bachelor’s Degree in History. I take my work very seriously and do it with enthusiasm; though, I must admit, it is not my foremost passion.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I work full time at Lakeland Regional Health Medical Center as an agent in the Physician’s Answering Service, where I connect healthcare personnel on the phone to facilitate consultations and discussions around patient care. Previously, I worked in Throughput Operations as a Coordinator; there, I screened patients admitted from the emergency department to assess their acuity and health needs, and then assigned them beds on the appropriate clinical units while keeping nursing staff needs in mind. I work closely with other departments around the hospital to provide excellent care in a timely and safe manner.</p>
<p>Many people consider their educations as necessary, but painful stepping stones to entering their preferred careers. I am passionate about history; discussion, research, writing, teaching, debating. All of these practices are carried out daily by university professors and students in the pursuit of Truth, truth, and truthes. What better place to practice my passion than the Academy? I cannot think of one.</p>
<p>I began college in 11th grade at Polk State Collegiate High School in Lakeland, FL. PSCHS was an odd beast; if you pushed yourself, you could graduate from high school with an Associate’s Degree, which I did in 2014. An unfortunate consequence of this milestone coming so soon developed as I left Lakeland to attend Nova Southeastern University in Davie, FL. At 18 and independent for the first time, I had difficult upper-level classes to attend to instead of enjoying the college experience. I became reclusive and did not do well as my foundations in the sciences was not strong enough to warrant the placement I had received in these higher-level courses. Chasing the AA at Polk meant skating by on some classes and losing the advantage I could have gained. I did not do well at Nova, academically. I learned a lot about myself, but not about premedical biology. Unfortunately, tuition was covering premedical biology, and self-discovery was free back in Lakeland.</p>
<p>Defeated, I returned to Lakeland and made a decision under pressure from my loved ones who were afraid to see me spiraling out of the lucrative medical field. I enrolled at Polk State again to become a nurse. After completing two semesters of prerequisite courses, I realized that medicine – the actual practice of caring for others using scientific principles in a clinical setting – was not on the table for me. I dropped out.</p>
<p>After some time off, I enrolled at the University of South Florida Tampa campus as a History major. I considered minors in Philosophy or Biomedical Ethics, hoping to use the background in Medical Humanities I had received at Nova to my advantage. I gave up on those minors, intent on working full time and getting good grades. I am, at least, working full time.</p>
<p>One day I’m going to graduate school. This December I applied to the University of South Florida’s History MA program and was rejected; I was not a good fit for the department, and my schizophrenic resume did not help my case. Now I’m developing a research proposal to apply to universities in Ireland and the United States. One day, I hope to be a university professor teaching and researching somewhere else in the world. The road is long and worthwhile, though steep at times and with turns containing surprises I cannot guess.</p>
<p>At least for this turn in the road, I have a decent plan. USF was my “safe choice” because I knew going in that it wouldn’t be a great fit. Being turned down actually just simplified the decision for me. I’m working this semester (spring 2018) to wrap up my BA and get ready for The Gap Year. I’m taking the 2018-2019 academic year off to work and put together a proposal for graduate schools in the US and Ireland, with the focus being, of course, on Ireland. Hopefully, I’ll be able to focus my time on developing a compelling direction for future research and assembling a bibliography.</p>
<p>I’m maintaining my proposal online with a dedicated GitHub repo and associated RTD in the near future.</p>
<p>It wasn’t feasible to move this year with my wife’s working life just getting started, so this year off should be a boon.</p>
<p>I started down the road to a college education with the goal of being a medical doctor. Then, I backed off to nursing. Now, I want to be a historian and I have a presence on GitHub, a notorious den of computer nerds. What a waste of time, right? I should probably focus on one thing. At least, that’s something I’ve been told.</p>
<p>I actually maintain that the diversity of my experience is feature, not a bug. Because of my education in the sciences, I have a lot of the requisite knowledge to do my job effectively and coordinate with clinical staff. I’m able to have complicated conversations with physicians and nurses despite being far behind them in expertise. I can understand the reasoning behind decisions made by administrative staff and clinical staff because I have a similar background. What’s more than a similar knowledge base is that I know how to access their knowledge with good questions, and that’s the basis of any decent education.</p>
<p>In the Academy, I’m able to bring in perspectives on inter-personal dynamics and a sense of critical time management that one learns in a hospital setting.</p>
